== Overview

This workload provisions a single centralized 3scale API Manager in a single OCP namespace.

This workload only needs to be executed once per OCP cluster.

It also allows for management (ie: creation / deletion) of a configurable number of API _tenants_ in the 3scale API Manager installation.

This role might be valuable in the following circumstances:

. *Instructor Led Training (ILTs), Hackathons and workshops*:
+
Given X number of students in an ILT requiring 3scale, provision a single central multi-tenant Red Hat 3scale API Manager where each student is assigned their own tenant.
+
The student is provided with administrative credentials to their assigned tenant.
+
This approach might be more desirable than the alternative where each student provisions their own 3scale API Manager.

. *Red Hat 3scale enablement*
+
A few learning objectives might be:

.. Demonstrate the provisioning of 3scale on OCP.
.. Integration with an external smtp provider to send out emails and facilitate a user self-registration workflow.
.. Invocation of the REST Admin API of 3scale using OAuth2 _access_ and _refresh_ tokens.

=== Prerequisites and assumptions


==== OpenShift Client and Cluster
. The version of 3scale provisioned in this lab (v2.4) is known to run on OpenShift Container Platform v3.11.*.
+
This version of OpenShift should already be pre-installed before executing this ansible role.

. Using a version of oc utility that corresponds to your target OCP cluster, ensure oc utility is already authenticated as the cluster-admin.

. This ansible role requires installation of the lxml and openshift python modules on target host executing this ansible. ie:
+
-----
# dnf install python3-lxml
# dnf install python3-openshift
-----

. Ensure that you are explicitly logged onto the master API of the OCP cluster, from your bastion node.
+
-----
# oc login master.<GUID>.openshift.opentlc.com
-----

==== Resource requirements

This ansible role allows for provisioning of 3scale of different sizes based on the value of the following ansible variable: _is_shared_cluster_

. Resource utilization: _is_shared_cluster = true_
.. The cluster quota for both CPU and RAM is set fairly high by default:
... CPU limit:  30 cores
... RAM limit:  30 Gi
.. The cpu and RAM limits defined in the 3scale API Manager template are also set fairly high.
.. These default settings are set intentionally high to allow for high throughput

. Resource utilization: _is_shared_cluster = false_
+
This is the default.
The resources needed to provision 3scale drops down to about 12 Gi RAM and 6 CPU


==== SMTP Providers
You'll want to have registered with an smtp provider to enable the 3scale API Manager with the ability to send emails.

In 3scale, smtp settings are configured globally and is leveraged by all API _tenants_.
When provisioning 3scale, you can specify the following ansible variables:

* smtp_host
* smtp_userid
* smtp_passwd
* smtp_authentication


A few SMTP providers with _Free Plans_ that this ansible role has been tested with are listed below:

. *SocketLabs:* Currently offering a free plan that allows for link:https://www.socketlabs.com/signup/[2000 emails per month]
. *SendGrid:* Currently offering a free plan that allows for link:https://sendgrid.com/pricing/[100 emails per day]

You can choose to provision your 3scale API Manager such that it is not configured to send emails.
To do so, ensure that the value of _smtp_userid_ = "changeme"

=== Ansible Set-up

. Install this role locally
+
-----
$ ansible-galaxy install gpe_mw_ansible.3scale_multitenant --force -p $HOME/.ansible/roles
-----

. Create Playbook:
+
-----
$ echo "
- hosts: all
  become: false
  gather_facts: False
  vars_files:
  roles:
    - gpe_mw_ansible.3scale_multitenant
" > /tmp/3scale_multitenant.yml
-----

=== Provision 3scale API manager

The OCP namespace for 3scale multi-tenant app will be owned by the following user: {{OCP_AMP_ADMIN_ID}}.

{{OCP_AMP_ADMIN_ID}} will be assigned a clusterquota so as to manage limits and requests assigned to 3scale

. Execute:
+
-----

# API manager provision
$ ansible-playbook -i localhost, -c local /tmp/3scale_multitenant.yml \
                    -e"ACTION=apimanager" \
                    -e"subdomain_base=$SUBDOMAIN_BASE" \
                    -e"OCP_AMP_ADMIN_ID=$OCP_AMP_ADMIN_ID" \
                    -e"API_MANAGER_NS=$API_MANAGER_NS" \
                    -e"smtp_port=$smtp_port" \
                    -e"smtp_authentication=$smtp_authentication" \
                    -e"smtp_host=$smtp_host" \
                    -e"smtp_userid=$smtp_userid" \
                    -e"smtp_passwd=$smtp_passwd" \
                    -e"is_shared_cluster=true" \
                    -e"rht_service_token_user=$rht_service_token_user" \
                    -e"rht_service_token_password=$rht_service_token_password" \
                    -e"use_rwo_for_cms=$use_rwo_for_cms"
-----

. After about 5 minutes, provisioning of the  API Manager should complete.
. Being that the API Manager is a large application with many different components, the components are broought up in an ordered manner.
+
Subsequently, the ansible places itself in a wait loop at each stage of the provisioning process.


=== Tenant management

==== Sequence of generic tenants

. This ansible can optionally create multiple tenants in the previously provisioned 3scale API Manager.  If so then ensure the following when invoking this ansible:

.. specify ACTION = "tenant_mgmt"
.. specify "start_tenant" and "end_tenant" variables
.. set value of CREATE_GWS_WITH_EACH_TENANT (true / false) to automate provisioning of a staging and production GW for each tenant


-----
START_TENANT=1
END_TENANT=1
CREATE_GWS_WITH_EACH_TENANT=true           #   if true, then an OCP project with API gateways will be created for each corresponding tenant in the same OCP cluster where API Manager resides

ocp_user_name_base=ocp                     #   base name of OCP users that will have access to their corresponding API Mgmt related projects.
                                           #   ie; if OCP user names are:  user01, user02, user03 ....... ,  then the value of this variable should be:  "user"
                                           #   default value = "ocp"

tenant_admin_user_name_base=api            #   base name of API users that will be admins of their API tenants (and admins of thier own API gateways)
                                           #   ie; if desired API user names are:  api01, api02, api03 ....... ,  then the value of this variable should be:  "api"
                                           #   default value = "api"

use_padded_tenant_numbers=true             #   if creating sequential generic tenants, specify whether the tenant names should include a padded numer or not
                                           #   ie;  ocp01, ocp02 ... ocp10    or ocp1, ocp2 ... ocp10
                                           #   default value is true
                                           #   default value corresponds to the defualt use of padded numbers in: https://github.com/gpe-mw-ansible-org/rh-sso-multi-realm


$ ansible-playbook -i localhost, -c local /tmp/3scale_multitenant.yml \
                    -e"ACTION=tenant_mgmt" \
                    -e"subdomain_base=$SUBDOMAIN_BASE" \
                    -e"API_MANAGER_NS=$API_MANAGER_NS" \
                    -e"start_tenant=$START_TENANT" \
                    -e"end_tenant=$END_TENANT" \
                    -e"adminEmailUser=$adminEmailUser" \
                    -e"adminEmailDomain=$adminEmailDomain" \
                    -e"create_gws_with_each_tenant=$CREATE_GWS_WITH_EACH_TENANT" \
                    -e"ocp_user_name_base=$ocp_user_name_base" \
                    -e"tenant_admin_user_name_base=$tenant_admin_user_name_base" \
                    -e"use_padded_tenant_numbers=$use_padded_tenant_numbers" \
                    -e"rht_service_token_user=$rht_service_token_user" \
                    -e"rht_service_token_password=$rht_service_token_password"
-----

. After the tenant provisioning completes, you will see messages similar to the following at the end of the ansible standard out:
+
-----
ok: [localhost] => {
    "msg": [
        "tenant_output_dir:  /home/jbride/provisioning_output/3295.openshift.opentlc.com/tenants_3scale-mt-api0",
        "tenant_provisioning_log_file = /home/jbride/provisioning_output/3295.openshift.opentlc.com/tenants_3scale-mt-api0/tenant_provisioning.log",
        "tenant_provisioning_results_file = /home/jbride/provisioning_output/3295.openshift.opentlc.com/tenants_3scale-mt-api0/tenant_info_file_1_2.txt",
        "start and end tenants = 1  2",
        "create API Gateways for each tenant = true"
    ]
}
-----
+
Feel free to review the files mentioned in those output messages.

. The _tenant_provisioning_results_file_ is particularly important to share details about API tenants with students.
+
This is a tab delimited file that can be imported into Google Spreadsheets and made accessible to students.

==== Named tenants

Alternative to the ability to create a sequence of generica tenants, a _named_ tenant can be created on an individual basis.


-----
orgName=openbanking-prod

ocpAdminId=ocp01                           #   name of OCP user that will have access to their corresponding API Mgmt related projects.

tenantAdminId=api01                        #   name of API user that will be the admin of their API tenants (and admins of thier own API gateways)

CREATE_GWS_WITH_EACH_TENANT=true           #   if true, then an OCP project with API gateways will be created for each corresponding tenant in the same OCP cluster where API Manager resides

gw_project_name=$orgName-gw


$ ansible-playbook -i localhost, -c local /tmp/3scale_multitenant.yml \
                    -e"ACTION=tenant_mgmt" \
                    -e"subdomain_base=$SUBDOMAIN_BASE" \
                    -e"API_MANAGER_NS=$API_MANAGER_NS" \
                    -e"adminEmailUser=$adminEmailUser" \
                    -e"adminEmailDomain=$adminEmailDomain" \
                    -e"create_gws_with_each_tenant=$CREATE_GWS_WITH_EACH_TENANT" \
                    -e"orgName=$orgName" \
                    -e"ocpAdminId=$ocpAdminId" \
                    -e"tenantAdminId=$tenantAdminId" \
                    -e"gw_project_name=$gw_project_name" \
                    -e"rht_service_token_user=$rht_service_token_user" \
                    -e"rht_service_token_password=$rht_service_token_password"
-----


==== Tenant User credentials

Each tenant is provisioned with a user that has admin privleges to that tenant.

The useId and password are generated using the following ansible variables found in defaults/main.yml:

. *Tenant admin userId:*  {{ tenant_admin_user_name_base }}  (ie:  api01, api02, api03 ...., api10 )
. *Tenant admin password:* {{ tenantAdminPasswd }}

=== Delete 3scale API manager

-----
REMOVE_TENANTS_ONLY=true
$ ansible-playbook -i localhost, -c local /tmp/3scale_multitenant.yml \
                    -e"ACTION=remove" \
                    -e"OCP_AMP_ADMIN_ID=$OCP_AMP_ADMIN_ID" \
                    -e"API_MANAGER_NS=$API_MANAGER_NS" \
                    -e"subdomain_base=$SUBDOMAIN_BASE" \
                    -e"REMOVE_TENANTS_ONLY=$REMOVE_TENANTS_ONLY"

== Stale _WILDCARD_DOMAIN_ State in API Manager
There may be scenarios where the DNS of your originally provisioned API Manager changes.
Specifically, the value of the _WILDCARD_DOMAIN_ parameter utilized in the original provisioning of your API Manager is no longer valid.

An example of a scenario where this might occur is in Ravello where the original provisioning of the 3scale API Manager would be captured as a Ravello _Blueprint_.
At runtime, a Ravello _application_ is instantiated from this Ravello _blueprint_ and the actual runtime DNS of the Ravello _application_ is applied.
This DNS applied to the runtime _application_ will be different than the DNS originally utilized when creating the _blueprint_.

To correct issues pertaining to this stale state, the following needs to occur :

. Update all routes in the namespace of your API Manager
. Update the stale URLs found in the _system.accounts_ table in the system-mysql database of the API Manager.
. Change the value of the _THREESCALE_SUPERDOMAIN_ variable in the configmap:  system-environment:

Examples of how to change the above are found link:https://gist.github.com/jbride/be32113707418cb43d73c9ef28a09b9d[here]
